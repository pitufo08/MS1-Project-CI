            <h6>
                Libella employed 3D mobile laser scanning technology to collect data and identify obstacles along the
                15-mile route.
                Libella’s 3D mobile laser scanning system provided a dense point cloud of data about the route in August
                of 2011.
                A video was also produced to show the conflicts and obstructions. In October of 2012, the shuttle moved
                successfully and without incident through the streets of Los Angeles, an event captured on national
                television.</h6>

        <div>
            <h5>City of Redmond Vertical Control <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> </h5>

            <h6>Libella delivered to the City of Redmond a datasheet for each of the 104 bench marks established on a
                grid system of approximately half-mile centers that included monument and location description
                photograph, NAD 83/91 bench mark coordinates and NAVD 88 elevations. The field crew performed to the
                Federal Geodetic Control Committee NGS Second Order, Class 1 Leveling specifications for vertical
                control surveys.</h6>

            <h5>LASER SCANNING AND MAPPING
                <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> </h5>

            <h6>Libella’s land surveying team worked with Snohomish County to provide monitoring and project management
                for the aerial mapping services required for the recovery efforts.
                Libella recovered existing Washington State Department of Transportation survey control points and set
                new control as needed to perform a limited “ground truthing” survey within the area. Libella also
                utilized 3D mobile laser scanning technology to create a topographic base map of SR 530 for use in the
                design-build effort to repair the damage to 1.5 miles of roadway caused by the landslide.</h6>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h5>LASER SCANNING AND MAPPING<i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> </h5>

            <h6>Libella determined the most efficient, accurate, safe, and cost-effective way to get the field survey
                completed was the use of Libella’s mobile laser scanning system to collect highly detailed ground-based
                LiDAR data and 360-degree digital photography throughout the project corridor.
                Libella used the mobile laser scan data to develop 3D polylines and point features that were taken into
                Civil 3D to develop the topographic base map and surface model to the City of Auburn’s CAD standards.
                The city was extremely impressed with the highly accurate surface model and completeness of the mapping.

        <div>
            <h5>Emergency Response Surveys<i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> </h5>

            <h6> Libella use 3D terrestrial High Definition Scanning (HDS) technology that allowed for data to be
                gathered safely from the roadway surface along the roadside canyon walls and riverbanks that had been
                rendered unstable from the flood waters. MicroStation drawings and InRoads Digital Terrain Modle (DTM)
                files were created for the surface along the two roadways for approximately 30 feet on both sides of the
                centerline (60 feet wide).</h6>

            <h5>Surveying services <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> </h5>

            <h6>Liella utilized the 3D static laser scanning technologies for efficiency and safety reasons, and was
                able to collect each stretch without entering into any lanes of traffic.
                Liella was also responsible for verifying the height of two overhead structures at the Baseline Road and
                Shelley interchanges. DEA also provided a complete GPS static network with points at 1-mile intervals
                for primary control and 1,000-foot intervals between secondary control throughout the project corridor.
